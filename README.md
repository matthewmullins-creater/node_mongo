# Node.js Express + MongoDB User API

This project is to build a simple Node.js Express API that connects to MongoDB using Mongoose, with a clear separation of concerns between the server logic and the data model. The API validates incoming user IDs, queries the database for users over age 21, and handles errors gracefully to ensure reliable and predictable responses. This structure makes the code easy to maintain and extend for future features.
